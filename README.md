# Vector_Quantization
Simple java program to apply the Lossy Vector Quantization Compression/Decompression technique using Images as input/output.

Vector quantization on gray level image,

inputs : Vector size and code book size

You should compress and decompress



For Compression Inputs will be :

1- Image

2- Code book Size

3- Vector Dimensions (n*m)

output:

1- compreesed image 

2- Code book



For Decompression your inputs will be :

1- compreesed image 

2- Code book

Output :

The decompressed image
